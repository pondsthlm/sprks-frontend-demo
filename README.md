## news

# easy and accessibility routing
uses reach router instead of react router
https://reach.tech/router

# no redux 
uses a redux like implimitation of the official react context api,
keep the reducer 
useStore gives the store and actions directly, 
no need to mapDispatch, mapState, connect, over and over again,  just use: 
`const { state, actions } = useStore();`
compatible with ,redux devtools.

redux devtools  is coming...
